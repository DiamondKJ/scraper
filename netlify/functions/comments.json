It\u2019s not uncommon to feel off after stopping Adderall, especially after long-term use. Your brain\u2019s chemistry can take time to rebalance, and that can absolutely show up as depression, anxiety, low energy, and brain fog. Add the frustration of trying meds that didn\u2019t work (or made things worse), and it\u2019s easy to feel stuck. **TRT** can help if low testosterone was part of the picture\u2014many guys feel a slow but steady lift in mood, energy, and clarity over time. **NAD+**\u2014some people report better focus, clearer thinking, and more physical stamina. It\u2019s not a cure-all, but it can be a helpful support, especially during recovery or burnout. **Reta and Glow 70**\u2014great you're trying nootropics and cellular support. **Peptides**\u2014you might look into: * **Selank** or **Semax** for anxiety and cognitive function * **BPC-157** for systemic healing and possibly mood regulation * **Dihexa** (experimental but promising) for brain fog Supplements people often swear by include: * **Magnesium (glycinate or threonate)** * **L-Tyrosine or DLPA** (especially post-stimulant) * **Omega-3s** (high EPA content for mood) * **Rhodiola or Ashwagandha** (adaptogens for stress and fatigue) All this said\u2014nothing replaces *consistency* in sleep, nutrition, movement, and support (therapy or a good friend group). You\u2019re not broken. Your brain\u2019s just healing\u2014and it takes time, patience, and sometimes a little trial and error. You\u2019re not alone in this. Keep going.",
