    "comment_text_cleaned":"I'm Eastern European by descent and while I can \"overdrink\" many people (I don't get drunk that easy) I get crazy bad hangovers. I mean so bad that I've had suicidal thoughts while hangovered (I'm not suicidal on general basis). Headache so bad that it feels like my head is going to blow up, diarhea, puking, general nausea, dizzy, hungry but can't eat, tired but can't sleep, muscle cramps etc. Like some serious shit, that's how much I can't tolerate alcohol. I've learnt later that certain populations have different alcohol metabolism and enzymes, and there was a name of the enzyme that makes your body to process alcohol slower (so not getting that much drunk quick) but intoxicate your body after. So I've stopped drinking to the level that would make me hangovered. The solution was simple. Being Polish-Canadian is difficult while not drinking. Everyone expects you to drink and to shovel vodka by full glasses. My business partner is like you. He wakes up after the whole night drinking and he's good to go. To touch base on your observations, I don't think those have anything to do with it, simply because: * **Neurodivergence**: I have ADHD * **Sinus\/Nasal Issues**: I deal with sinus\/nasal issues regurarly * **GABA Imbalance**: IDK here * **Painkillers**: I feel psychological relief from pain killers too, and most people do btw. * **MTHFR Gene**: that's one of the things that I am talking about but check on enzymes * **Sleep Deprivation**: I experience mood increase when I'm mildly sleep-deprivated * **Chronic Fatigue\/Anhedonia**: hard to comment on that. In my philosophy, us humans were not made to be happy. we are made to survive. so I don't expect to feel elevated every single time. Once you accept it, it feels better to feel shitty lol.",

    "comment_text_cleaned":"Higher glutamate release the next day? I thought that was what is behind the effect, because alcohol is gabaergic and when you remove that, some glutamate overcompensating remain the next day. ( I never dug to find what really were the causes) Since sleep deprivation has a similar effect, (this one because of dopamine receptors being more sensitive), maybe the sleep disturbances from alcohol makes a similar effect. Acetaldehyde: Does the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde makes a \"hormesis stress\" and makes us produce more endogenous antioxidant (glutathione, superoxide dismutase or whatever) ? Does the metabolised acetaldehyde making an acetate that is consumed by mitochondria raise mental energy significantly enough to \"feel it\"? Idk ( some people consume vinegar for the acetate benefits; it's seems to actually be a small chain fatty acid )",

    "comment_text_cleaned":"As someone who also have issues with stimulants and take atomoxetine, although for other reasons, you have my sympathy. Personally, atomoxetine works fine for the restlessness and agitation i normally feel 24\/7, its improved my life immensely, but it does nothing for my focus or energy. The best thing I've tested so far is low doses of LSD, 20-50\u0173 gives me energy, focus, motivation, and increased stamina with very minor side effects. Only issue is the legality of it and how annoying it is to source quality product. Of course, do your own research for this one, I'm just a guy on the Internet and psychedelics are some serious compounds that shouldn't be taken lightly.",
